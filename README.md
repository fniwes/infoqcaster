# Infoq Caster

Cast and infoq video presentation to a Chromecast and see the slides on your computer.

## Background
Infoq is one of the best places for software developers to learn new things and listen to conferences that we were unable to be in person.

But there is no way to use my Chromecast device connected to my home TV to see the presentation, while using my Laptop PC to view at the slides. I am forced to do both on the same screen. **It is a shame**

Also, I want some pet project to investigate about Chromecast development and Grails3.

## How to use
Just clone the repository, and use Grail3 to run the application. It will start a webserver on port 8080. Just navigate to http://localhost:8080, supply a url to a infoq presentation, if you have a chromecast then cast the page to your tv, and enjoy!
